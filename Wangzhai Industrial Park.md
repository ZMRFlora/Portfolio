- Site Location: Wangzhai Village, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China
- Problem: Population loss, low economic and cultural vitality, need new drive for the revitalization of the village. 
- Description: Wangzhai village is adjacent to WKU and in the planning area of Kean Town. However, due to the governmental planning and economic reasons, most of the villagers have moved away from the village, only some of the elder people left, which make the village aging and lack young or new vitality. The design aimed to solve these problems and bring new vitality into the village.
